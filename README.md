# EverestBot
Fork of Robocop-ng for the Celeste Discord. WIP. Original README follows:

# Robocop-ng

Next-gen rewrite of Kurisu/Robocop bot used on ReSwitched bot with discord.py rewrite, designed to be relatively clean, consistent and un-bloated.

Code is based on https://gitlab.com/ao/dpybotbase and https://github.com/916253/Kurisu-Reswitched.


---

## How to run

- Copy `config.py.template` to `config.py`, configure all necessary parts to your server.
- Install python3.6+.
- Install python dependencies (`pip3 install -Ur requirements.txt`, you might need to put `sudo -H` before that)
- If you're moving from Kurisu or Robocop: Follow `Tips for people moving from Kurisu/Robocop` below.
- Run `Robocop.py` (`python3 Robocop.py`)

To keep the bot running, you might want to use pm2 or a systemd service.

## Tips for people moving from Kurisu/Robocop

If you're moving from Kurisu/Robocop, and want to preserve your data, you'll want to do the following steps:

- Copy your `data` folder over.
- Rename your `data/warnsv2.json` file to `data/userlog.json`.
- Edit `data/restrictions.json` and replace role names (`"Muted"` etc) with role IDs (`526500080879140874` etc). Make sure to have it as int, not as str (don't wrap role id with `"` or `'`).

Main goal of this project is to get Robocop functionality done, secondary goal is adding new features. The following entries are secondary, less "urgent" goals:

- [x] Better security, better checks and better guild whitelisting
- [ ] New verification feature: Using log module from akbbot for logging attempts and removing old attempts
- [ ] New moderation feature: watch-unwatch (using log module from akbbot)
- [ ] New feature: Modmail
- [ ] New feature: Submiterr (relies on modmail)
- [ ] New feature: Highlights (problematic words automatically get posted to modmail channel, relies on modmail)
- [ ] Feature creep: Shortlink completion (gl/ao/etc)
- [ ] Feature creep: Pleroma embedding
- [x] A system for running jobs in background with an interval (will be called robocronp)
- [x] Commands to list said jobs and remove them
- [x] New moderation feature: timemute (mute with time, relies on robocronp)
- [x] New moderation feature: timeban (ban with expiry, relies on robocronp)
- [ ] New moderation feature: timelock (channel lockdown with time, relies on robocronp)
- [x] Improvements to lockdown to ensure that staff can talk
- [x] New moderation feature: Display of mutes, bans and kicks on listwarns (.userlog now)
- [x] New moderation feature: User notes
- [x] New moderation feature: Reaction removing features (thanks misson20000!)
- [x] New moderation feature: User nickname change
- [x] New self-moderation feature: .mywarns
- [x] Remove sh, remove risky stuff from eval

<details>
<summary>TODO for robocronp</summary>
<p>

[ ] Reduce code repetition on mod_timed.py

the following require me to rethink some of the lockdown code, which I don't feel like

[ ] lockdown in helper
[ ] timelock command
[ ] working cronjob for unlock

</p>
